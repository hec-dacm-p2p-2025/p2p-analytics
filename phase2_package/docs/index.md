# Overview

`p2p-analytics` is a lightweight analysis package built on top of the automated Binance P2P / BCB data pipeline developed in Phase 1 of the project. It provides reusable functions for exploring market structure, spreads, premiums, behavior across fiat currencies, and short-term volatility patterns.

The package consumes the parquet datasets generated by Phase 1 and produces ready-to-visualize tables for Phase 3 dashboards (Streamlit).

### Key capabilities

- Load Binance P2P data or official exchange rates through unified loader functions
- Compute BUY–SELL spreads and intraday price profiles
- Compare fiat markets across countries
- Measure premium vs. official exchange rate
- Analyze microstructure (order imbalance, liquidity signals)
- Produce summary statistics and rolling volatility indicators
- Export outputs directly into Power BI-friendly files

This package is meant to be simple, modular, and easy to integrate into any downstream analytics workflow.
